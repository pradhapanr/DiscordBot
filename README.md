# Chess and League Bot

### A discord bot made to cater to a particular friend group.

This bot was put together as a small project to make easy tasks even easier. With this bot, things like
flipping a coin, formulating a poll, creating an online chess match, or comparing stats and positions in ranking on the
popular game League of Legends can be done in simple text commands on the discord server the bot is on.

This bot was made with use of the Discord.js library as well as the Node.js library for the server. User data was stored
in a local MongoDB client.

Further improvements in the future will include:

-   Listing most recently played League of Legends game with details!
-   Recording chess games with a win/loss counter for each user!
-   Experience system (based on the amount a user interacts in the server)
