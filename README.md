# Chess and League Bot

### A discord bot made to cater to a particular friend group.

This bot was put together as a small project to make easy tasks even easier. With this bot, things like
flipping a coin, formulating a poll, creating an online chess match, or comparing stats and positions in ranking on the
popular game League of Legends can be done in simple text commands on the discord server the bot is on.

This project was intended to help me build a strong grasp on using some of Javascript's libraries effectively, as well as working with different
APIs and getting comfortable making GET and POST requests. The APIs I worked with in this project were the Riot Games
League of Legends API as well as the Lichess API.

This bot was made with the use of the Discord.js library as well as Node.js for managing the server. Axios was used to
make API calls. User data was stored in a local MongoDB client.

### Setup

After pulling code to a local repository on the machine you are hosting the bot on simply run the command:

  node main.js

Further improvements in the future will include:

-   Listing most recently played League of Legends game with details!
-   Recording chess games with a win/loss counter for each user!
-   Experience system (based on the amount a user interacts in the server)
